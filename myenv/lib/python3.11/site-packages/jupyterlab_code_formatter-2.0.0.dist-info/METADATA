*A JupyterLab plugin to facilitate invocation of code formatters.*

PSA: This plugin is currently undergoing a major refactor, bear with me while I work on this.

Documentation: [Hosted on GitHub Pages](https://ryantam626.github.io/jupyterlab_code_formatter/index.html)

This is currently out of date. I will be updating that shortly.

## Quick Start

I recommend you going to the [documentation site](https://ryantam626.github.io/jupyterlab_code_formatter/index.html#quick-start), but this should work too.

1. **Install the package**
```bash
pip install jupyterlab-code-formatter
```

2. **Install some supported formatters** (isort+black are default for Python)
```bash
# NOTE: Install black and isort,
#       JL code formatter is configured to invoke isort and black by default
pip install black isort
```

3. **Restart JupyterLab**

This plugin includes a server plugin, restart JupyterLab if you have followed the above steps while it's running.

4. **Configure plugin**

To configure which/how formatters are invoked, see [configuration](https://ryantam626.github.io/jupyterlab_code_formatter/configuration.html).
